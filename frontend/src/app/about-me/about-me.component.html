        <p style="margin-top: 30px; text-indent: 30px; ">It all started when I was just a wee lad. My father introduced me to the world of technology through video games. My passion for technology began with one of the most popular games during the 90s, Super Mario World. Later in my life, I was allowed to play one of the best online games of the century, Runescape. Runescape is where I found a passion for programming in Java during the devastating days of high school. After I graduated from Clear Lake High School, I went to the University of Houston - Clear Lake to study Computer Engineering. The reasoning for Computer Engineering instead of Computer Science was that I wanted to know how programming languages interfaced with Electronics. I was able to absorb programming languages such as C, C#, Java, VHDL, and Assembly. I also picked up some C++ in my spare time while searching through the vast oceans of youtube. <br>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 30px; text-indent: 30px; ">
        Besides programming, I learned about Computer Architecture, Digital Circuit design, Linear Circuits, and Systems Engineering. During the last year of my degree, I joined a small team of 5 engineering students on a senior project to create an automatic treadmill that would increase/decrease its speed depending on the user's heart rate. This project used a combination of software and hardware and was called <a [routerLink]="['/project','2']">Smart Treadmill</a>. Smart Treadmill follows the teachings of Dr. Phil Maffetone methodology of keeping your heart rate at the desired heart rate.
        </p><p style="text-align: center;">Desired_Heart_Rate = 180 - Your_Age</p> <p style="text-indent: 30px; " >The project was well received by the Engineering faculty and students. After graduation, I decided to improve my knowledge of C# by developing my application to automate gameplay for a video game, I named this application <a [routerLink]="['/project','1']">The Automated Game Player</a>. I completed all of the functionality that I set out to accomplish when starting this project, but I still revisit it periodically to add new methods, functionality, and UI/UX updates.

        <p style="margin-top: 30px; text-indent: 30px; ">
        I was approached shortly after by a staffing company called Cognixia. While being a member of Cognixia's JUMPlus program, I focused primarily on Full-Stack Web Development training. The curriculum included programming languages such as Java and JavaScript, and frameworks such as Spring, Springboot, React, and Angular. Cognixia's training included use of MySQL and MongoDB databases, and cloud services such as Amazon Web Services' EC2 Instances and S3 Buckets. The projects that I worked on during my employment with Cognixia were mainly mock E-Commerce and Banking Applications, such as my <a [routerLink]="['/project','3']">Dollars Bank</a> and <a [routerLink]="['/project','4']">Core Java Shopping App</a>.
            After my contract concluded with Cognixia, I decided I wanted to build a portfolio website.  </p>
